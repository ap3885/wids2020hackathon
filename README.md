# WiDS 2020 Hackathon

The WiDS Datathon 2020 focuses on patient health through data from MITâ€™s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiative. 

The challenge is to create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival. MIT's GOSSIS community initiative, with privacy certification from the Harvard Privacy Lab, has provided a dataset of more than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe. This data is part of a growing global effort and consortium spanning Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and more than 200 hospitals in the United States.
